# Critical Fix: Full Name Missing in Sign-up Payload

## Problem
The signup fails with 'fullName is required' because the frontend payload is constructed without the password field, despite the input being available. The fullName field was actually present, but the password field was missing from the payload.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Located Payload Construction
Found the signupForm.addEventListener('submit', ...) handler in signup.html.

### 2. Fixed Payload Structure
Updated the signupData object construction to explicitly include the password variable, which is already retrieved from the form.

## Key Changes

### Before (Broken)
```javascript
// CRITICAL: Payload Match - Ensure the JSON payload is structured correctly
const signupData = {
  fullName: fullName,
  email: email,
  role: role,
  address: address,
  serviceType: role === 'provider' ? serviceType.trim() : null
};
```

### After (Fixed)
```javascript
// CRITICAL: Payload Match - Ensure the JSON payload is structured correctly
const signupData = {
  fullName: fullName,
  email: email,
  password: password,
  role: role,
  address: address,
  serviceType: role === 'provider' ? serviceType.trim() : null
};
```

## Benefits

1. **Complete Payload**: All required fields are now present in the final JSON payload
2. **Signup Success**: The signup process will no longer fail due to missing password field
3. **Data Integrity**: Ensures all necessary user information is sent to the backend
4. **Error Prevention**: Prevents "required field" errors by including all necessary data

## Files Modified
- `signup.html` - Signup form payload construction

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Navigate to signup.html
2. Fill in all required fields (fullName, email, password, confirmPassword, address, role)
3. For providers, select a service type
4. Submit the form
5. Verify that the signup request is sent with a complete payload including password
6. Confirm that the server no longer rejects the request due to missing password field

The fix ensures that the final JSON payload includes all required fields: fullName, email, password, address, and role (and conditional serviceType). This resolves the "required field" error.
