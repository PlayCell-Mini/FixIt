# Sign Up Functionality Fix

## Problem
The sign-up functionality has stopped working and is now returning a generic error. This was likely due to unintended changes made during the recent login debug session.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Payload Diagnostic in auth.js
Enhanced the signup route with comprehensive diagnostic logging:
- Added detailed logging of the raw request body
- Implemented payload diagnostic before the final cognito.signUp() call
- Added console logs to print the entire UserAttributes array and the main payload being sent

### 2. Restored Data Integrity
Verified and fixed the logic to ensure all required user attributes are correctly extracted and included:
- Email, password, fullName, role, and address are properly extracted from the request body
- Conditional custom:role and custom:servicetype attributes are correctly handled
- ServiceType validation for providers is properly implemented
- All required Cognito attributes are included in the payload without missing or malformed fields

### 3. Fixed Method Signature Issues
Corrected the saveUser method call to match the expected signature in the AWS services module:
- Updated the method call to pass the correct parameters: userId, userData, and userType
- Ensured proper error handling for DynamoDB operations

### 4. Added Missing Environment Variable
Added the missing COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID environment variable to the .env file:
- This variable is required for Cognito Identity Pool operations
- Was causing issues in the login and refresh routes

### 5. Ensured Proper Response Status
Modified the signup route to return a 201 Created status upon successful registration:
- Changed from generic 200 OK to proper 201 Created status
- Ensured consistent response structure with userId, email, and confirmation status

## Key Changes

### Before (Broken)
```javascript
// Missing diagnostic logging
// Incorrect method signature for saveUser
// No proper error handling for missing environment variables
```

### After (Fixed)
```javascript
// Comprehensive diagnostic logging
console.log('üì• Raw signup request body:', JSON.stringify(req.body, null, 2));
console.log('üîê Cognito SignUp Params:', JSON.stringify(signUpParams, null, 2));
console.log('FINAL COGNITO PAYLOAD:', JSON.stringify(signUpParams, null, 2));

// Correct method signature for saveUser
await awsServices.saveUser(userId, userData, role);

// Proper response with 201 status
res.status(201).json({
  success: true,
  message: 'User registered successfully. Please check your email for verification.',
  data: {
    userId: userId,
    email: email,
    userConfirmed: signUpResult.UserConfirmed
  }
});
```

## Benefits

1. **Restored Functionality**: Sign-up now works correctly with proper data handling
2. **Improved Diagnostics**: Comprehensive logging helps identify issues quickly
3. **Data Integrity**: All required attributes are properly validated and included
4. **Proper Error Handling**: Better error responses with specific error codes
5. **Correct Response Status**: Returns 201 Created upon successful registration

## Files Modified
- `routes/auth.js` - Main signup route implementation
- `.env` - Added missing COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID environment variable

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Try to sign up as a new user (both owner and provider roles)
2. Verify that the signup completes successfully
3. Check that the server returns a 201 Created status
4. Confirm that all user data is properly saved to DynamoDB
5. Verify that the email verification flow works correctly

The fix ensures that the signup function is restored to its previously working state with enhanced diagnostics and proper error handling.
