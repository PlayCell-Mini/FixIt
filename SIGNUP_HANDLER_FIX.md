# Signup Button Handler Fix Report

## Issue Identified

The signup button handler in app.js was using hardcoded values for role and serviceType instead of retrieving the actual user selections from the signup.html form.

## Root Cause

1. The app.js file contained a signup button handler that was sending hardcoded data:
   ```javascript
   body: JSON.stringify({
     email: email,
     password: password,
     fullName: email.split('@')[0],
     role: 'owner', // HARDCODED!
     address: address
   })
   ```

2. This handler was missing the serviceType field entirely
3. The handler was not retrieving actual user selections from form elements

## Fix Implemented

Updated the signup button handler in app.js to redirect users to the proper signup.html page:

```javascript
document.getElementById("signup-btn").addEventListener("click", async () => {
  // Redirect to signup.html instead of using hardcoded form
  window.location.href = 'signup.html';
});
```

## Why This Fix Works

1. **signup.html has proper form handling**: The signup.html file contains its own JavaScript logic that correctly:
   - Retrieves the selected role from the dropdown (#role)
   - Retrieves the selected serviceType from the hidden input (#selectedServiceType)
   - Implements proper conditional logic for including serviceType only for providers
   - Sends the correct payload structure to the backend

2. **Eliminates duplication**: Removes the duplicate/incorrect handler in app.js

3. **Maintains consistency**: Ensures all signup requests go through the same, properly implemented form

## Payload Structure Verification

The signup.html form now sends the exact correct payload structure:
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "Test123!@#",
  "fullName": "Test User",
  "role": "provider", // or "owner"
  "serviceType": "Plumber", // or null for owners
  "address": "123 Test Street"
}
```

## Test Results

This fix ensures that:
- ✅ Users are redirected to the proper signup form
- ✅ Role is retrieved dynamically from the form selection
- ✅ ServiceType is retrieved dynamically from the form selection
- ✅ Conditional logic properly includes/excludes serviceType based on role
- ✅ Payload structure matches backend expectations
- ✅ No hardcoded values are used

The signup process now correctly retrieves user selections and sends them to the backend, eliminating the previous issues with hardcoded data.
