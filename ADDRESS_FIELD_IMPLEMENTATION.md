# Address Field Implementation - Complete ✅

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation of the required address field for Cognito User Pool signup.

---

## 📋 Implementation Summary

### 1. HTML Form Update (signup.html)

**Location**: Between password confirmation and role selection fields

**HTML Code Added**:
```html
<div class="input-group">
  <label for="address-input" class="input-label">Address</label>
  <input 
    type="text" 
    id="address-input" 
    class="form-input" 
    placeholder="Enter your full address" 
    required 
  />
</div>
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Field ID: `#address-input` (as required)
- ✅ HTML5 `required` attribute for browser validation
- ✅ Consistent styling with existing form inputs
- ✅ Proper label for accessibility
- ✅ Helpful placeholder text

---

### 2. Frontend JavaScript Update (signup.html)

**DOM Element Reference**:
```javascript
const addressInput = document.getElementById('address-input');
```

**Focus Effects** - Added to input array:
```javascript
const inputs = [fullNameInput, emailInput, passwordInput, confirmPasswordInput, addressInput, roleSelect];
```

**Form Validation** - Added address validation:
```javascript
// Extract address value
const address = addressInput.value.trim();

// Check if all fields are filled
if (!fullName || !email || !password || !confirmPassword || !address || !role) {
  showError('Please fill in all fields');
  return;
}

// Validate address length (minimum 10 characters)
if (address.length < 10) {
  showError('Please enter a complete address (at least 10 characters)');
  return;
}
```

**API Request** - Include address in signup payload:
```javascript
const signUpResult = await aws.signUp(email, password, {
  fullName: fullName,
  role: role,
  address: address,  // ✅ Address included
  serviceType: null
});
```

**Enter Key Support** - Added address input to keyboard handler:
```javascript
[fullNameInput, emailInput, passwordInput, confirmPasswordInput, addressInput, roleSelect].forEach(input => {
  input.addEventListener('keypress', function(e) {
    if (e.key === 'Enter') {
      signupForm.dispatchEvent(new Event('submit'));
    }
  });
});
```

### 3. AWS Service Update (awsConfig.js)

**Updated signUp method to include address**:
```javascript
async signUp(email, password, userData = {}) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/auth/signup', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        email,
        password,
        fullName: userData.fullName || '',
        role: userData.role || 'seeker',
        serviceType: userData.serviceType || null,
        address: userData.address || ''  // ✅ Address parameter added
      })
    });
    // ... rest of implementation
  }
}
```

---

### 4. Backend API Update (routes/auth.js)

**Extract address from request body**:
```javascript
const { email, password, fullName, role, serviceType, address } = req.body;
```

**Validate address**:
```javascript
// Validate address (required by Cognito User Pool)
if (!address || !address.trim()) {
  return res.status(400).json({
    success: false,
    error: 'Missing address',
    message: 'Address is required for sign-up'
  });
}
```

**Add to Cognito UserAttributes**:
```javascript
const signUpParams = {
  ClientId: process.env.COGNITO_CLIENT_ID,
  Username: email,
  Password: password,
  UserAttributes: [
    { Name: 'email', Value: email },
    { Name: 'name', Value: fullName },
    { Name: 'address', Value: address },  // ✅ Standard Cognito attribute
    { Name: 'custom:role', Value: role }
  ]
};
```

## 🔄 Complete Data Flow

### Frontend (signup.html)
1. User fills in signup form including address field
2. JavaScript validates address (must be at least 10 characters)
3. On form submit, address is included in API request

### AWS Config (awsConfig.js)
4. `awsService.signUp()` receives address in userData object
5. Includes address in POST request to `/api/auth/signup`

### Backend (routes/auth.js)
6. Express route extracts address from request body
7. Validates address is provided and not empty
8. Adds address to Cognito UserAttributes array
9. Calls `cognito.signUp()` with all attributes including address

### AWS Cognito
10. Cognito User Pool receives signup request
11. Validates all required attributes (including address)
12. Creates user account with address stored

---

## ✅ Validation Rules

### Frontend Validation
- **Required**: Address field cannot be empty
- **Minimum Length**: 10 characters
- **Error Message**: "Please enter a complete address (at least 10 characters)"

### Backend Validation
- **Required**: Address must be provided in request body
- **Non-Empty**: Address cannot be empty string or whitespace only
- **Error Response**: 
  ```json
  {
    "success": false,
    "error": "Missing address",
    "message": "Address is required for sign-up"
  }
  ```

## 🎨 UI/UX Consistency

The address field maintains complete consistency with existing form fields:

✅ **CSS Classes**: Uses same `input-group`, `input-label`, `form-input` classes
✅ **Focus Effects**: Included in focus/blur event handlers
✅ **Keyboard Support**: Enter key triggers form submission
✅ **Visual Styling**: Matches existing password and email fields
✅ **Responsive**: Works with existing mobile and desktop layouts
✅ **Accessibility**: Proper label association for screen readers
