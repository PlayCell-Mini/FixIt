# Confirm Password Fix

## Problem
The confirmPassword field was not being included in the debug log statement, which could cause confusion during troubleshooting. However, the confirmPassword field was correctly being used for validation purposes and was not supposed to be included in the payload sent to the backend.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Debug Log Statement
Updated the debug log statement to include all form values including password and confirmPassword for better troubleshooting.

## Key Changes

### Before (Incomplete Debug Log)
```javascript
// Log the values for debugging
console.log('ðŸ“‹ Form values:', { fullName, email, role, serviceType, address });
```

### After (Complete Debug Log)
```javascript
// Log the values for debugging
console.log('ðŸ“‹ Form values:', { fullName, email, password, confirmPassword, role, serviceType, address });
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Debugging**: All form values are now visible in the debug log for troubleshooting
2. **Validation Clarity**: Makes it clear that confirmPassword is being retrieved and used for validation
3. **No Functional Change**: The actual functionality remains the same since confirmPassword should not be sent to the backend

## Files Modified
- `signup.html` - Debug log statement in the signup form submit handler

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Navigate to signup.html
2. Fill in all required fields (fullName, email, password, confirmPassword, address, role)
3. For providers, select a service type
4. Check the browser console to verify that all form values including password and confirmPassword are logged
5. Submit the form
6. Verify that the signup request is sent with the correct payload (without confirmPassword)

The fix ensures that the debug log includes all form values for better troubleshooting while maintaining the correct behavior of not sending confirmPassword to the backend.
