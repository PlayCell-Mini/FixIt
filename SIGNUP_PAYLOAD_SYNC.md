# Signup Payload Synchronization Report

## Issue Analysis

The user reported that the live browser signup was failing with configuration errors, despite the incremental-cognito-test.js working correctly. This indicated a mismatch between the payload sent from the frontend and the backend.

## Root Cause Identified

1. **Frontend Payload Issue**: The awsConfig.js file was defaulting to 'seeker' instead of 'owner' for the role attribute
2. **Backend Functionality**: The backend was working correctly, as confirmed by direct API tests

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Default Role in awsConfig.js
Changed the default role from 'seeker' to 'owner' in the signUp method:
```javascript
// Before
role: userData.role || 'seeker',

// After
role: userData.role || 'owner',
```

### 2. Verified Payload Structure
Confirmed that the signup.html form correctly retrieves and sends:
- `role` from the role selection dropdown
- `serviceType` from the selected service type (when role is 'provider')
- `fullName`, `email`, `password`, and `address` from form fields

## Test Results

### Direct API Test Results
- ✅ Owner Signup: SUCCESS (201)
- ❌ Provider Signup: FAILED (400) - "Type for attribute {custom:serviceType} could not be determined"

### Analysis
The failure is still related to the Cognito User Pool configuration for the `custom:serviceType` attribute, not the payload structure.

## Payload Structure Verification

The signup.html form now sends the exact same payload structure as our successful tests:
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "Test123!@#",
  "fullName": "Test User",
  "role": "provider",
  "serviceType": "Plumber",
  "address": "123 Test Street"
}
```

## Conclusion

The frontend payload synchronization issue has been resolved:
1. ✅ The signup.html form correctly retrieves all form values
2. ✅ The awsConfig.js default role has been fixed
3. ✅ The payload structure matches the successful test scripts
4. ✅ Owner signup works correctly
5. ❌ Provider signup still fails due to Cognito configuration issues

The remaining issue is with the AWS Cognito User Pool configuration for the `custom:serviceType` attribute, which needs to be properly defined with the correct data type and write permissions.
