# AWS Dynamic Initialization Fix

## Problem
The dashboard was failing to execute any AWS-related functions (upload, profile load/save) because the AWS SDK was not being initialized with the temporary credentials stored in localStorage. The error "AWS Service not initialized" was occurring because of missing dynamic setup.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified awsConfig.js

#### Added Dynamic Initialization Function
- Created a new core function `initDynamically()` that:
  - Checks `localStorage.getItem('awsTempCredentials')` for saved keys
  - If keys are found, uses `AWS.config.update({...})` with temporary accessKeyId, secretAccessKey, and sessionToken
  - If keys are missing, throws the error: "Please login first to get temporary credentials."

#### Updated AWS Service Methods
- Modified `ensureInitialized()` to automatically call `initDynamically()` if not already initialized
- Updated all AWS-dependent methods (`getUserProfile`, `updateUserProfile`, `saveUserProfile`) to ensure initialization before operations

#### Enhanced Authentication Flow
- Modified `signIn()` method to store AWS temporary credentials in localStorage
- Modified `signOut()` method to remove AWS temporary credentials from localStorage

### 2. Updated provider-dashboard.html

#### Modified All AWS-Dependent Functions
- Updated `loadUserProfile()` to call dynamic initialization before AWS operations
- Updated `initializeProfileForm()` to call dynamic initialization before AWS operations
- Updated `saveBtn.addEventListener()` to call dynamic initialization before AWS operations
- Updated real-time polling function to call dynamic initialization before AWS operations

### 3. Updated apiClient.js

#### Enhanced Credential Storage
- Modified `login()` method to store AWS temporary credentials in localStorage
- Modified `refreshCredentials()` method to update AWS temporary credentials in localStorage

## Key Changes Summary

1. **Dynamic AWS Initialization**: AWS SDK is now configured with correct temporary keys just before any AWS-related action is executed
2. **Persistent Credentials**: Temporary AWS credentials are stored in localStorage during login and removed during logout
3. **Automatic Initialization**: AWS services automatically initialize when needed, eliminating the "AWS Service not initialized" error
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Clear error messages when credentials are missing or expired

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Log in as a provider
2. Open the profile edit modal
3. Verify that profile data loads correctly
4. Make changes and save
5. Verify that the profile picture uploads successfully
6. Confirm that changes are saved to DynamoDB
